# StyleClip

A nimble Sketch plugin that allows copying an element's styles directly to your Mac clipboard. It supports clipboarding raw CSS styles and can create SCSS variable definitions and SCSS styles to match.

**Note: while all 3 functions work to an extent, they have not been fully tested and are not necessarily production-ready.**

## Installation

Move StyleClip.sketchplugin into your Plugins folder in Sketch or double-click StyleClip.sketchplugin

## Usage

You can use the plugin by selecting StyleClip from the Plugins dropdown in the menu bar or using these keyboard shortcuts:

* Cmd + shift + Y: Clip Raw CSS Styles - Copy raw CSS associated with this element
* Cmd + shift + U: Clip SCSS Globals - Generates and copies SCSS colors associated used in the current mockup
* Cmd + shift + I: Clip SCSS Styles - Copy SCSS styles associated with this element
